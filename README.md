# SwiftModules-Web
The purpose of the SwiftModules organization is to allow a group of iOS developers
to work together to port existing Open Source libraries from Objective-C to
Swift. Since Swift is still new and we are all still learning we can work on 
porting these existing libraries together.

We can use GitHub to coordinate the work and stay in touch using [Slack](http://swiftmodules.slack.com).

If you are interested in joining the effort please message me on Twitter at [@brennanSV](http://twitter.com/brennanSV).
